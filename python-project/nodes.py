def set_current_node(visited, currentDistances):
    # visited is a set that contains the names of the nodes marked as visited. E.g. {'A', 'C'}.
    # currentDistances is a dictionary that contains the current minimum distance of each node. E.g. {'A': 0, 'B': 3, 'C': 5}

    return "A" #fix me: return the label of the node that should be set as "current node".
